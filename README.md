<h1>Disk Management Utility</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consist of me practicing how to partition and format a disk drive in a Windows virtual machine. Partitions are important because a file system can't function without one. When you have a new disk drive, one partition is needed to be able to write files to the file system. Different partitions can also have different file formats, depending on their purpose.
